<h1> Quick hummus recipe </h1> 

This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads. 

<h2> Ingredients  </h2>

<ul>
	<li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans) </li>
	<li>175g of tahini </li>
	<li>6 sundried tomatoes </li>
	<li>Half a red pepper </li>
	<li>A pinch of cayenne pepper </li>
	<li>1 clove of garlic </li>
	<li>A dash of olive oil </li>
</ul>

<h2> Instructions  </h2>

<ol> 
	<li> Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely </li>
	<li> Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely </li>
	<li> Add all the ingredients into a food processor </li>
	<li> Process all the ingredients into a paste. 
		<ul>
			<li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
			<li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>	  
</ol>

<h2>Storage</h2> 
<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
